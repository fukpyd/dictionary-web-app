## General info
Dictionary Web App was the first project for my portfolio. The main goal I set was to practice knowledge of SCSS, JavaScript and API I gained for few months. The layout and idea came from Frontend Mentor challenge, which you can find here Frontend Mentor | Dictionary web app coding challenge.
